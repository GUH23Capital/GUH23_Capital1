# GUH23_CapitalOne
## Inspiration
We only use online banking such as Sterling, Monzo etc. We got the inspiration from the application insights. What we wanted to achieve is to provide users of CapitalOne with visualized information easily by scripting.
## What it does
It takes the data from the API. l The visualization result shows all kinds of transactions including fraud transactions history through a map where the transactions are made and shows the clustered result of  transactions by message. It also displays how much each merchant earned and the number of transactions made by each fraud account.

## How we built it

We shared our ideas what to visualized and divided our groups into two. 
We then decided what which area we want to focus in such as transactions and frauds.
Then we decided how to visualize it such as maps, graphs, and clusters.
We used pandas, flask

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up the postman
Analyzing the data from the API (Initially there was a lot of data.)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
proud that we have selected our own norm of clustering and organized a lot of information based on the criteria that people will be curious about.

## What we learned
API, NLP, Postman, GitHUB

## What's next for CapitalOne_BEE
Try to automate fully process
Implement large language model
